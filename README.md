# CPU-Scheduler Project

This project simulates the FCFS, SJF, and MLFQ scheduling algorithms for CPU scheduling. It was built using Python object-oriented programming in the PyCharm IDE.

The project aims to demonstrate the different algorithms' effectiveness in handling CPU scheduling tasks and their impact on the system's overall performance.
